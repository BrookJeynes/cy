# API

This is a complete listing of all of the API functions that `cy` provides in the top-level Janet environment (ie you do not need to `import` or `use` anything.)

Janet code executed with `cy` can also access everything from [Janet's standard library](https://janet-lang.org/api/index.html) except for anything in `spork`. In addition, Janet's `ev` family of functions probably will not work; I have never tested them.
