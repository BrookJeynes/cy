# Acknowledgements

**cy** is the result of hundreds of hours of work[^note]. I would like to thank the following people for their efforts to support me in this project:

- A.J., with particular gratitude for contributing the name `taro` and a few of the original ideas that inspired `cy`
- S.K., for pushing me to pursue this bizarre blend of art and utility
- 然然, for being a persistent source of inspiration
- B.P., for being a sounding board in the early days when I had no idea whether `cy` was even possible
- And countless others who noticed what I was doing when I worked on `cy` in coffee shops, on airplanes, and elsewhere
