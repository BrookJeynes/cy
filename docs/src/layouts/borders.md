# Borders

Some nodes have a `:border` property that determines the appearance of the node's borders. The border property can be one of the following keywords:

- `:normal`
- `:rounded`
- `:block`
- `:outer-half`
- `:inner-half`
- `:thick`
- `:double`
- `:hidden`
- `:none`

`:hidden` still renders the border with blank cells; `:none` does not render a border at all.
