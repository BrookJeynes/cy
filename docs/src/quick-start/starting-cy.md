# Starting cy

To start `cy` after installation, just run `cy` without any arguments. If a `cy` server is not already running, `cy` will start one.

{{story png splash}}

`cy` shows a splash screen on startup that looks like this. To clear it, press any key.

You can kill the cy server by hitting {{bind :root ctrl+a q}} and detach from it (but leave the server running) with {{bind :root ctrl+a d}}.
