# Starting cy

To start `cy` after installation, just run `cy` without any arguments. `cy` will connect to the `cy` server, starting one if necessary.

{{story png splash}}

`cy` shows a splash screen on startup that looks like this. To clear it, press any key.

You can kill the cy server by hitting `ctrl+a` `q` and detach from it (but leave the server running) with `ctrl+a` `d`.
