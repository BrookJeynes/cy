# Using the command palette

{{story cast cy/palette --width 120 --height 26}}

Like most modern applications, `cy` includes a command palette, which lets you search through and execute all of the available [actions](./keybindings.md#actions). You can access it by typing {{bind :root ctrl+a ctrl+p}}. The command palette shows the key to which each action is bound on the right side of the fuzzy finder.

There are some interesting things buried in the command palette. Try out the `Browse animations.` action!
