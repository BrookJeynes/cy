# ctrl+r

Hitting {{bind :root ctrl+a ctrl+r}} allows you to choose a command from your command history and insert it into your current pane. This works just like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [atuin](https://atuin.sh/) et al, but it also gives you a preview of what the screen looked like when you executed that command.

In addition, you can also use the same interface to open a particular command from your history in [replay mode](/replay-mode.md) using the {{bind :root ctrl+a f}} binding.
