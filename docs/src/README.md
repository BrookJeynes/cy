**cy** is an experimental terminal multiplexer. It builds on the traditional paradigms of `tmux` and `screen` with advances in form, function, and customization.

Key features:

- [Replay and search through](./concepts.md#replay) any terminal session
- Flexible configuration with [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/), a simple imperative programming language
- Built-in fuzzy finding using concepts from [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
