# geom

Package geom provides a range of geometric primitives and convenience methods. Notably, it contains:

* Data types for representing static bitmaps of terminal data (`image.Image`) and terminal state (`tty.State`).
* `Vec2`, a traditional vector data type but with a terminal flavor: ie it uses `R` and `C` (for rows and columns) instead of `X` and `Y`
