## What is this?

`cy` is an experimental terminal multiplexer that aims to be a simple, modern, and ergonomic alternative to `tmux`. You can find out more in **[the documentation](https://cfoust.github.io/cy/)**.

The `cy` project has a few main goals:

- To shape the experience of using terminal applications.
- Be beautiful, fast, and easy-to-use, particularly for users who have not used `tmux` or who are intimidated by its default configuration.
- Allow users to search in and replay any `cy` session.
